KEPLER was implemented on a GPU-accelerated Minikube Kubernetes cluster with access to NVIDIA GPUs. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Siamese Network models were trained on the cluster, and power metrics exported by KEPLER were analyzed using Grafana. Patterns in the power consumption metrics of the machine learning models were studied to identify strategies for reducing the workload‚Äôs power consumption.",

A standardized weight is pre-set to the load cell. The change in weight sensed by it is sent to the Raspberry Pi.
